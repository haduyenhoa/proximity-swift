# proximity-swift
Swift version of Proximity

Based on ideas of Proximity (https://github.com/revned/proximity), this project is for create the same application in Swift, for Mac. 
In 1.0, application detects bluetooth connectivity to an iDevice in order to know if we have "out of range" or "in range" with the Mac.

In later version, I will add something that is more sophisticated.

This project is separated into 2 sub projects
+ MyMac: iOS application to be installed in iOS (will be more fun)
+ Proximity: Mac application to manager your Mac via bluetooth connection to the iDevice
